**Note**
- Due to time limitations, we did not plan to make this mobile responsive. For best experience view on a laptop/computer.

## Brief
The course instructors had partnered students with other classmates to design and collaboratively build a MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.js) stack app of their own design.

> **Server side**
* Use Mongo, Node & Express to build a server-side API
* API must have at least 2 related models, one of which should be a user
* API should include all RESTFUL actions for at least one of those models.
* Include authentication to restrict access to appropriate users
* Include at least one referenced or embedded sub-document
* Include automated tests

> **Client side**
* Use AngularJS
* Use SCSS
* Use Webpack & Yarn** to manage your dependencies and compile your source code

## Concept

A site to list various galleries and the exhibitions that are currently on. Users are able to read reviews, bookmark exhibitions and contribute to comment threads about particular exhibitions.

## How we worked
With only 7 days to fulfil the brief and incorporate our ideas, we made sure we planned everything carefully.

- Time management. MVP focused project management.
- We decided to use Trello Technology to assign tasks and track progress.
- Daily morning stand up and git version control methods were used.
